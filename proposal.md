## Description

I want to create a 2D voxel/platformer world,
    (kinda like Celeste but wayy smaller scale and with more story rather than skill)
I'm not sure about the story structure,
    (It could be either visual novel style, or it could be more adventure style)
But I want it to feel like something that's worth working on.

## *Needs* to have (Minimum viable product)

- A walkable world.
- Have elements be interactable.
- Background scenery, with different layers.
- - There should be different z layers, and everything should be pushed to the pixels array only when something changes.
- NO MOUSE INTERACTION!!!
- SFX. Music not required, but some sort of wind blowing SFX is mandatory.
- - Possibly use OpenGameArt for those SFX.

## *Nice* to have

- A way to handle errors such that it details the error on it's own in the console.
- - And also just even handling errors would be nice lol.
- Idle animations (I WANNA DO THIS)
- - And these idle animations will be more detailed than
- Shader? Flat colors just don't look good without a bunch of attention to detail.

## Idea

- Game engine??
- Walkable world?
- - Have destructable world??
- - Use perlin.
- **2D voxel world**
- - Story elements?
- - Gives learning on pixel art.
- - Deltarune style? Less battles. 
- - Kinda like a 2D platformer, but without the platforming.
- - - Like the game 'Hue', but with pixels instead.
- Maybe some kind of DAW??
- - What do I need for a DAW?
- Visual Novel?
- LMMS plugins?

## Smaller tasks to complete

- Interact button must be 'e'
- - Must act like a 2D platformer with other controls.
- - - W is up, D is down.
