## Description

I want to create a 2D voxel/platformer world,
    (kinda like Celeste but wayy smaller scale and with more story rather than skill)
I'm not sure about the story structure,
    (It could be either visual novel style, or it could be more adventure style)
But I want it to feel like something that's worth working on.

** IMPORTANT: I have to consider p5 additions for physics (possibly p5play) **

## *Needs* to have (Minimum viable product)

- A walkable world. âœ…
- Have elements be interactable.
- Background scenery, with different layers. âœ… (Different layers weren't possible, but they are rendered in a specific order.)
- - There should be different z layers, and everything should be pushed to the pixels array only when something changes.
- - - I don't know if there's enough processing power in one thread to render shaders. It would be nice to have shadows though.
- NO MOUSE INTERACTION!!! Any mouse interaction is considered a fail. âœ… (Movement of the mouse does not count. Clicking does.)
- SFX. Music not required, but some sort of wind blowing SFX is mandatory.
- - Possibly use OpenGameArt for those SFX.

## *Nice* to have

- A way to handle errors such that it details the error on it's own in the console.
- - And also just even handling errors would be nice lol.
- Idle animations (I WANNA DO THIS)
- - And these idle animations will be more detailed than
- Shader? Flat colors just don't look good without a bunch of attention to detail.
- Different biomes.
- - A WATER LEVEL!!!
- - - The water level music should be very calm and not use a **** ton of tropical sounds.
- - Each biome needs a small introduction.
- - Each biome should feel interesting and vibrant and mysterious at first (wondrous).
- Maybe some sort of meta story, such that different effects are applied to the screen due to the meta story.
- - The meta story should not be the focus, and must link to the story ingame.
- Add a translation for french.

## Idea

- Game engine??
- Walkable world?
- - Have destructable world??
- - Use perlin.
- **2D voxel world**
- - Story elements?
- - Gives learning on pixel art.
- - Deltarune style? Less battles. 
- - Kinda like a 2D platformer, but without the platforming.
- - - Like the game 'Hue', but with pixels instead.
- Maybe some kind of DAW??
- - What do I need for a DAW?
- Visual Novel?
- LMMS plugins?

## Smaller tasks to complete

- Interact button must be 'e'
- - Must act like a 2D platformer with other controls.
- - - W is up, D is down.
